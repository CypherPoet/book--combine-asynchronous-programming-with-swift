//: The unique characteristic of `multicast(_:)` is that the publisher it returns is a `ConnectablePublisher`.
//:
//: What this means is it wonâ€™t subscribe to the upstream publisher until you call its `connect()`.
//:
//: This leaves you ample time to set up all the subscribers you need before letting it connect
//: to the upstream publisher and start the task.
