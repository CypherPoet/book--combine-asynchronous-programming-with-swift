//: ðŸ¥… Challenge: Filter all the things
//:
//: Create an example that publishes a collection of numbers from 1 through 100,
//: and use filtering operators to:
//:
//: - Skip the first 50 values emitted by the upstream publisher.
//: - Take the next 20 values after those first 50 values.
//: - Only take even numbers.
//:
//:     The output of your example should produce the following numbers, one per line:
//:
//:     52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70
//:
